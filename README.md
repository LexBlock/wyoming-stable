Wyoming Stablecoin - technical considerations

Stablecoins and affiliated technologies should improve national security and bolster financial opportunities by enforcing best practices and simplifying the tedious reporting required to work with local, state, and federal reporting requirements.  

The Metal and Proton networks supported by https://metallicus.com/ have already completed the requirements to participate with the Federal Reserve and leverage solidity smart contract network originally developed on the Ethereum network.  We recommend using this for a baseline network and would add to it the following ISO standards and markup languages that are already in widespread use to simplify the use of stablecoins in traditional businesses:


[ISO 20022 https://www.iso20022.org/] - A universal financial industry message scheme that provides a common platform for the development of messages in the financial services industry. It covers financial information transferred between financial institutions.
XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) - A freely available and global framework for exchanging business information. It is used to define and exchange financial reporting data and is used by the SEC and IRS among other federal agencies for reporting.
US GAAP - used by the IRS for declaring the tax burden of a given transaction
SWIFT Standards - SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) provides a standardized messaging format and protocol for financial transactions between member banks.
Open Financial Exchange (OFX) - A unified XML-based standard for the electronic exchange of financial data between financial institutions, businesses and consumers via the internet.

These standards might be added to the token or built in with schematic attestations https://attest.sh/ to reduce the use of smart contracts which are often subject to hacking attempts.  Attestations would also simplify use of zero-knowledge proofs to allow Wyoming stablecoin users greater privacy and flexibility in their transactions and holdings.
